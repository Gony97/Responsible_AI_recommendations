# Final Project in Responsible AI, Law, Ethics & Society: 

## Feedback Loop and Amplification in Recommendation Systems 

### Project concept:

Recommendation system governs big part of our digital and content consumptions in: social media, streaming services and Ecommerce. What are the long-term consequences of relying on the recommendation of a system over and over again, and at the same time, this system is being shaped by the users’ actions?
Given that recommendation systems in the industry aim to optimize and increase time spent on a given platform, many (in effect) will lead to recommendation systems that produce echo chambers and filtered content feeds that tailor to the user's specific preferences and point of views. While this may not be strictly inappropriate or problematic in some cases, in other contexts, such as news consumption, this could lead to the propagation of harmful material that may elicit detrimental interactions and exposure to otherwise irrelevant material. “Echo chambers”, built on algorithmic recommendation systems fine tuned to the users preferences, limit the content and the diversification of the information flow to which the user is exposed to, known as a “filter bubble”. In the context of news distribution which highly contributes to shaping the users political standing and identity, echo chambers formed by recommendation systems have potentially cataclysmic effects to the foundations of democracy, by enhancing levels of polarization in the population.


### Data Source:
The news article recommendation system would require two datasets: All the News and Articles Sharing and Reading from CI&T DeskDrop, which includes many news articles and their properties, and user's impression logs.

### Methods:
Training Models to classify the political lean of newx articles (left-wing/central/right-wing)
Examine users interaction with news articles (view, like, comment, share)

### Finding:
The majority of users tend to engage primarily with news articles that align with their particular viewpoint, while a significant number of users avoid interacting all together with articles that present different perspectives.
